Note: drone.get_state_log() in the tellolib.py was not working properly (it was returning empty), 
so I modified the started code by sending fake data to the telemetry table in the database in place 
of the actual data in order to demonstrate that my update table and pulling from the telemetry table 
in the database functions correctly. In the console, you can see that when I print out ("DRONE LOG: ", log)
it just returns empty. This issue was brought up in the slidespace discussion board. It seems that many people
have ths issue, and I speculate it is becuase some models of the drone are slightly different to the
professor's, so some of the code in the API does not work properly with our drones.
